Thoughts:
I have really struggled with this project. This has been a very difficult journey this far and I wish my idea was not so conceptual. I wish I had a creative partner to bounce ideas off of at this point. 
Selfies are a reflection of self and so is this project. I don't know. I want to make something I am proud of but also want to make something that has a point. At this stage I feel lost and confused about my project and very apprehensive about the final! I am documenting a lot of my process through selfies...but for some reason I can't get them to load here....
