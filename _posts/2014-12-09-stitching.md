Away I go! I have been attempting some practice stitching. It's going to take MUCH longer than I thought. It's crazy. I definitely have a new found respect for this craft. I have done it before but never at this scale and never a map. I love textiles and definitely am glad I am working toward a final piece that uses them to display data.
