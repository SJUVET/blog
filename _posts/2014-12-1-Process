Tough Thoughts:
Most of my process is happening in my mind. I am have decided to do a cross stitch.
People tend to view needlework as very crafty and ultimately falls under "women's work"
I think that's also how selfies are viewed. As something girls or women mostly do and that it is born from insecurity. I disagree.
I also love exploring the historical value of cross stitch and mapping. Some cross stitched or needlework maps are family heirlooms or document a cultural history.
