Got supplies from Michael's to play with. I have decided to make a large scale cross stitch. Not sure of what exactly but it will relate to selfies. If I have time and energy I will also make a digital version in Mapbox. I am learning a lot about GitHub and my creative process. It is slow and internal. 
Will I do a cross stitch of facial features or an actual map? Not sure yet. 

Here they are:
Scissors, Aida Cloth (large cross stitch fabric), embroidery thread pack, gold cord, embroidery hoops and tapestry needles

An example of cross stitched facial feature using a software...not that inspiring.
