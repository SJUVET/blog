I am so exhausted. I have invested probably about 30+ hours of stitching into this thing! I like it, but I recognize I would like to actually continue for maybe ever. I have a hard time pulling myself away from this thing. I want the states outlined. I want to fill in all of the water. I want the stitches to take up more space and really fill it out. I am so proud that I was able to commit and make an map that is tactile like I had originally wanted. I might sew this onto a canvas for final presentation or onto fabric to make it more like a quilt or as a wall tapestry.

From the beginning I have wanted to do both a physical interpretation and a digital one. So I made a map in Map Box. The cross stitched map is data from Time Magazine's Selfiest Cities. I used stitch colors and size to show which US cities are the Selfiest according to their data (see preliminary research blog article)
The digital map are locations I have taken selfies over the past year. They are differentiated by yellow and red markers showing if it was a solo selfie or a group shot.
