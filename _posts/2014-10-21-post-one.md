Through conversations and research I decided to focus on Mapping the #Selfie
Questions I ask:
Why do we do it?
We all do it.
Sometimes we do it together.
Where do we do it?
Is it narcissism or vulnerability?
What is the difference between a selfie and a self portrait?
Do women take them more often than men?
Do Millenials take them more? Is it a millenial phenomenon? I hate the term "millenial"
Is it art?
Are we just trying to prove our existence?
Do likes mean love? Self love or self esteem?
Why are people critical of people taking selfies?
Why you mad?

Famous and funny selfies:
